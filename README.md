# FlockCon2
## Third Party /f/lockdraw Chat Client for Windows - By Ninjihaku Software :3

### Important note

I DO NOT OWN /f/lockdraw, NOR I AM INVOLVED IN IT'S DEVELOPMENT IN ANY WAY. THIS PROGRAM
IS A THIRD PARTY PROGRAM.

### Quick Introduction
/f/lockdraw is a fork of a flash-based, collaborative drawing software named flockdraw.
The service include many features like rooms, many basic drawing tools, moderation tools,
and a chat. Their official site is: http://skycow.us/

FlockCon2 allows you to chat in any room (except the main room) as if it were some short
of IRC room instead of a drawing room.

### Download precompiled binaries

Download them from here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fzotj6k9x7rmvkp/flockchat-R2015W3510.zip?dl=0

Just decompress them anywhere, run the executable, and enjoy.

### Compile from source

You need:

· MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/)
· MSYS (http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys)

Simply go to the source folder (The source is in the root of the directory tree), and use the
'make' command to build the entire project. The binaries will be generated inside the bin folder.

You do not need any additional libraries, it should be compilable out of the box.
